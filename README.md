## FE-Civil-Exam-Calculator

This open-source calculator was created by a senior Civil Engineering student at The University of Texas at Tyler, who is also a 2024 FE Exam candidate. It is designed to help engineering students and professionals dive deep into engineering concepts while simultaneously honing their Python programming skills. 

The project welcomes contributions and suggestions from the community, and it is integrated with a Telegram bot for easy access and usage.

這個開源計算器是由德克薩斯大學泰勒分校土木工程學生創建的，他也是 2024 年 FE 考試的考生。它旨在幫助工程專業的學生和專業人士深入了解工程概念，同時磨練他的 Python 程式設計技能。
該計畫歡迎貢獻和建議，並與 Telegram 機器人集成，以便於訪問和使用。
